Requirements
Fields
To have a useful list of events, we need to ensure that the following information is available for each event [Mandatory]:
1.	Event ID
2.	Event Source ID
3.	Event Source Provider Name
4.	Event Name
5.	Event Lat/Long
6.	Event Start Date
7.	Event End Date

Additionally, we would like to collect the following data points when they are available [Optional]:
8.	Event category (Business, Leisure, MICE, etc.)
9.	Recurring Event Flag
10.	Bank Holiday Flag
11.	Event Address
12.	Event City
13.	Event Country


Curation Logic
There are essentially 3 steps to the curation logic: Mapping, Cleaning and De-duping.
Mapping
All events that are added to our system should get a unique ID that enables to identify them and ensure that we can track them back. This ID should be generated by us (to avoid having multisource ID conflicts) but we should also keep the source event ID if the source provides one.
Cleaning
Any event added to our database should be run through the following checks. If the event doesn’t pass one of those checks, he should receive an invalid flag. Otherwise, he should be marked as valid.

Invalid event name	•	Check that the event has a name
•	Check that the event name is readable and doesn’t include strings of characters (for instance “>@#!” or “///”).
Invalidate event location	•	Check that the event has a lat/long
•	Check that this lat/long exists
•	Check that this lat/long is not 0;0
Invalid event date	•	Check that the event has a start and end date and that it is valid
	


We should also ensure that other data fields are cleaned up and/or populated
Event Source ID	•	ID of the event as given in the source (e.g in the “Eventful” api, etc.)
Event Source Provider Name	•	Name of the service provider for the given event (e.g “Eventful” or “HolidayAPI”)
Event category	•	If Event category is not readable and doesn’t include strings of characters (for instance “>@#!” or “///”), we should clear it
Event Address	•	Based on the Lat/Long, we should attach an address, city and country to the event to simplify the consumption from stakeholders
•	For events that do not have addresses (Bank holidays), leave this field empty
Bank Holiday Event	•	This field should be computed based on information we get from the source. For instance, all events coming from the source “BankHoliday events API” should be flagged as Bank Holiday
Gaia Region ID	Logic TBD
